    intro:
      title: Introduction
      content: Tracks is designed to be integrated with scripts, web services, and
        third-party applications. This page serves as the documentation of our REST
        API.
      content_2: The Tracks REST API allows developers to integrate Tracks into their
        applications. It allows applications to access and modify Tracks data, and
        is implemented as Vanilla XML over HTTP.
      content_3: The API is a %{restful_link} service. All data is available through
        the API as a resource to which can be referred using a unique identifier.
        It responds to a number of the HTTP methods, specifically GET, PUT, POST and
        UPDATE, and all responses from the API are in a simple XML format encoded
        as UTF-8.
      restful_link_text: RESTful
    auth:
      title: Authentication
      content: Authentication is handled using %{auth_link}. Your Tracks username
        and password is used as the authentication credentials for the API. Note that
        in Basic HTTP authentication, your password is sent in clear text. If you
        need a more secure authentication solution, you should configure your web
        server to run Tracks under HTTPS.
      basic_auth_link_text: Basic HTTP authentication
    retrieve:
      title: Retrieving data from the API
      content: 'To retrieve data you only need to do an HTTP GET on a resource identifier.
        For example, if you want to get all the contexts with %{curl_link}:'
      single_context: 'Getting a single context:'
      todos_from_context: 'Getting the todos within a context:'
      projects: You also can apply the pattern shown above with projects instead of
        contexts.

      limit: 'For the todo resources (todos, tickler, done, hidden and calendar) you

        %{active_code} and set it to some value like this:'

      example_note_response_title: 'The response is an %{response_code} with in the
        body the XML representation of the updated todo. We provide a shorcut method
        to toggle a todo done or undone without having to perform the update with
        the right field values:'
      example_delete_title: 'If we want to delete that todo we can call its unique
        resource identifier (the URL) with the HTTP method %{delete}, again with curl:'
      example_delete_response_title: The API returns an %{response_code} and the todo
        is now deleted.

      title: Dealing with the response and response status
      description: All successful operations respond with a status code of %{response_200}
        or %{response_201} depending on the operation. Sometimes a list, say %{example_call}
