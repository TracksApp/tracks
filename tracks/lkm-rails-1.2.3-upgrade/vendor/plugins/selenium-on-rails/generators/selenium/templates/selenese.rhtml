It's often a good idea to start the test with opening <tt>/selenium/setup</tt> (see "here":/selenium/setup for more info).

|open|/selenium/setup|
|open|/|
|assertTitle|Home|

More information about the commands is available "here":http://release.openqa.org/selenium-core/nightly/reference.html.

You can write comments above and below the commands, but you can only have one set of commands, i.e. one table, per test. "RedCloth":http://www.whytheluckystiff.net/ruby/redcloth/ is used for formatting if installed.

Point the browser to "<%= testcase_link %>":<%= testcase_link %> to see how this test is rendered, or to "<%= suite_link %>":<%= suite_link %> to run the suite.
