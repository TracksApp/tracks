1. Resources

Tracks is using
* github to host the git repository.
* Assembla to manage bugs and enhancement request.
* the mailing list to discuss features and development and interact with users

See README for links to the respective sites

Also see the Development pages on the wiki for details on installing, upgrading, etc.

2. Dependencies

The dependencies for Tracks are maintained using bundler. Before starting your
tracks instance, you'll need to run 'bundle install' to fetch all the
dependencies

3. Wiki

There are some pointers for setting up your Tracks copy for testing at
https://github.com/TracksApp/tracks/wiki/Testing/

4. SQLITE3 FOR TESTING

By default, tests are configured to run using sqlite3 in memory mode to
increase speed. You will need the sqlite3-ruby gem for this.

To avoid showing the migrations as tests are run, add the following to your
database.yml below 'database: ":memory:"':

  verbosity: quiet

If you want to run tests using another database, that's fine, too. Just change
your database.yml accordingly.

5. Test::Unit tests

To run the Test::Unit tests run

  rake test

Running the above command will run through the unit, functional, and
integration tests for Tracks. Use 'rake -T' to see a list of all rake tasks to
determine how to run each section of tests separately.

6. RSpec tests

To run the RSpec tests run

  rake spec

7. Cucumber tests

To run the cucumber test run

  rake cucumber

and for those using javascript/ajax use

  rake cucumber:selenium

In order to run the selenium tests, you'll need to have Firefox 3.x installed.
Newer versions won't work.

See the wiki for more information on testing: https://github.com/TracksApp/tracks/wiki/Testing
