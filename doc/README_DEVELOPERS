1. Resources

Tracks is using
* github to host the git repository.
* Assembla to manage bugs and enhancement request.
* the mailing list to discuss features and development
* the forum to discuss with users

See README for links to the respective sites

2. Dependencies

The dependencies are maintained by Tracks. For development we try not to vendor them

Install them using

  rake gems:install RAILS_ENV=development
  rake gems:install RAILS_ENV=test
  rake gems:install RAILS_ENV=selenium

3. Wiki

There are some pointers for setting up your Tracks copy for testing at http://www.getontracks.org/wiki/Testing/

4. SQLITE3 FOR TESTING

By default, tests are configured to run using sqlite3 in memory mode to increase speed. You will need the sqlite3-ruby gem for this.

To avoid showing the migrations as tests are run, add the following to your database.yml below 'database: ":memory:"':

  verbosity: quiet

If you want to run tests using another database, that's fine, too. Just change your database.yml accordingly.

5. SELENIUM TESTS (Selenium on Rails)

This testing style is deprecated and are being moved over to Selenium via Cucumber.

See the wiki for more information to run the tests that are not yet migrated: http://www.getontracks.org/wiki/Testing

6. RSPEC tests

To run the RSpec tests run

  rake spec

7. Cucumber tests

To run the cucumber test run

  rake cucumber

and for those using javascript/ajax use

  rake cucumber:selenium
